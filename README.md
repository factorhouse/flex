Flex is an Enterprise-grade toolkit for engineers working with Apache Flink that:

* Ships as a single docker-container or JAR file
* You deploy and secure like any other Enterprise web-application
* Runs air-gapped with all information stored within your cloud
* Is trusted by the world's largest companies, from publishing to payments networks
* Has a simple, transparent pricing structure
* Is built and supported by an engineering-lead team deeply experienced in Flink delivery

The Flex image is available directly from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/factorhouse/flex). Images are built using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/factorhouse/flex/actions/workflows/build.yml).
